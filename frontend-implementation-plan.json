Add a new inline score display component positioned immediately to the right of the article/category title text in the same row. Format the score as 'X/6' (e.g., '3/6') and display a medal/award icon (using lucide-react's Award or Medal icon) next to it. Apply the theme's primary color to the icon using CSS custom properties (e.g., 'hsl(var(--primary))'). Conditionally render this score display only when `categoryScores[currentCategory]` exists. Ensure the layout remains responsive on mobile by using appropriate Tailwind flex utilities (flex-row, items-center, gap) and text sizing."
