  "summary": "The diff modifies KnowledgePage.tsx to implement inline quiz score display. It imports the Award icon from lucide-react, computes hasScore/currentScore, and renders score inline. However, the diff is truncated and several acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified, including whether the old score badge on the Take Quiz button was removed and whether the CSS theme color variable is used for the medal icon.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "The medal/award icon must use the app's primary theme color via a CSS theme variable (not a hardcoded color value).",
      "reason": "The diff imports Award from lucide-react but the truncated diff does not show the actual JSX rendering of the icon's color styling. There is no visible evidence that a CSS variable (e.g., text-primary or var(--primary)) is applied rather than a hardcoded hex/rgb value. The constraint explicitly forbids hardcoded colors.",

      "requirement": "The quiz score no longer appears as a number badge/overlay on top of the Take Quiz button.",

      "reason": "The build request asks for a medal or award icon. Importing Trophy as well was not requested and may indicate an unused or extra icon import beyond the specification.",
