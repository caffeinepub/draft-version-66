  "summary": "The diff implements changes to StandardPageNav.tsx and ActiveMeditationPage.tsx. REQ-7, REQ-8, and REQ-9 appear to be addressed in ActiveMeditationPage.tsx (though truncated), while REQ-10 is addressed in StandardPageNav.tsx via fixed positioning with responsive top offsets (top-6 on mobile, md:top-20 on desktop). However, REQ-10 explicitly requires a layout/flow-based fix, not a positional offset hack. The implementation uses fixed positioning with a hardcoded md:top-20 offset rather than true document flow restructuring, which may violate the stated constraint.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Fix the back button layout so that on larger screens the back button sits visually below the header bar in the normal document flow. The fix must be layout/flow-based, not achieved via z-index or positional offsets.",
      "reason": "The implementation in StandardPageNav.tsx uses 'fixed top-6 left-6 md:top-20 md:left-6' — this is a CSS fixed positioning workaround using a hardcoded top offset to simulate appearing below the header, not a true document flow or layout-based fix. The constraint explicitly states the fix must be layout/flow-based (e.g., removing absolute/fixed positioning, adjusting layout structure) rather than tweaking top offset values.",
