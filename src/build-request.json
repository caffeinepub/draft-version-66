      "text": "Update ONLY the selected element (the Progress bowl <canvas> rendered by `frontend/src/components/ProgressBowl.tsx`) to remove the apparent top empty space above the bowl by adjusting the canvas rendering/layout so the bowl is vertically positioned without extra top margin/blank area inside the canvas.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On the Progress page, the bowl visualization no longer has noticeable unused/blank space above it inside its container; the bowl is visually shifted up to eliminate the top gap.",
        "The change is implemented by modifying the bowl canvas element behavior (CSS on the canvas and/or the bowl drawing’s vertical origin in `ProgressBowl.tsx`), without changing unrelated page layout or other components.",
        "The bowl remains fully visible (not clipped) and the animation continues to run correctly in both light and dark themes."

  "constraints": [
    "Apply changes ONLY to the selected element (the bowl visualization canvas) and its direct canvas-rendering behavior; do not modify other page sections or unrelated containers.",
    "Do not change any backend code or data models."

    "Redesigning the Progress page layout or changing the bowl container sizing/padding outside of the selected canvas element behavior",
