        "On the Pre‑Meditation page, within the guide parent container '1j6s3jt', the '1dl1fqs' “More details” button renders at the bottom edge of that container (visually below the guide content).",
        "When the guide content height changes (short vs. long text), the '1dl1fqs' button remains at the bottom of the container and does not float mid-container.",
        "The button continues to perform its existing navigation behavior (redirect to Knowledge page) without introducing regressions."

Keep the existing click handler/navigation logic unchanged and avoid modifying unrelated elements listed in non-goals."
