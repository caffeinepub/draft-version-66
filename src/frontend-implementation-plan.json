        "On the Progress page, the bowl visualization no longer has noticeable unused/blank space above it inside its container; the bowl is visually shifted up to eliminate the top gap.",
        "The change is implemented by modifying the bowl canvas element behavior (CSS on the canvas and/or the bowl drawing’s vertical origin in `ProgressBowl.tsx`), without changing unrelated page layout or other components.",
        "The bowl remains fully visible (not clipped) and the animation continues to run correctly in both light and dark themes."

          "description": "Update only the ProgressBowl canvas-rendering behavior to remove the apparent top empty space by shifting the drawing’s vertical origin upward (e.g., compute a smaller `bowlTop`/adjust `centerY` based on the bowl’s true drawn bounds) so the bowl’s bounding box sits higher within the 300x300 canvas while remaining fully visible and not clipped. Keep animation loop and theme-aware colors intact; do not modify parent/page layout outside the canvas element."
