## Summary
**Goal:** Improve Pre-Meditation and active session UI usability by fixing button label overflow and correcting/aligning key meditation controls.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Pre-Meditation page “More Details” button label to exactly “More Details” (English) without changing its existing navigation/deep link behavior.
- Change the active session Play/Pause control to a circular icon button (instead of a square button) while keeping the icon centered responsively.
- Left-align the “Volume” and “Adjusting Time” labels so each sits above-left and aligned to the left edge of its corresponding control container across screen sizes.
- Fix the “Adjusting Time” slider so left-to-right thumb position and track fill visually match the selected value (left = less time, right = more time), removing any inverted behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** On small screens, the Pre-Meditation “More Details” button no longer overflows; during an active meditation, the Play/Pause button is round, control labels align properly, and the Adjusting Time slider behaves visually as expected.
