# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the meditation active-session controls area more compact and visually centered as a single grouped block.

**Planned changes:**
- Center the selected active-session UI group (canvas + timer + controls container) within the viewport as one block, without changing alignment of other page sections.
- Reduce the play/pause button *container* size to at least 2× smaller while keeping the icon size the same; ensure the button remains accessible and functional.
- Slightly reduce the timer display size (modest reduction only) without affecting other text.
- Moderately reduce vertical spacing within the selected controls container so the time and volume sliders sit closer together, limited to that container.

**User-visible outcome:** The active meditation session area appears centered as a cohesive unit, with a smaller play/pause button container, a slightly smaller timer, and more compact spacing between the sliders—without changing other parts of the page.
