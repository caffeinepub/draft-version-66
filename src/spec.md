# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refine UI controls on pre-meditation and meditation pages for better sizing, clarity, and usability.

**Planned changes:**
- Reduce height of Begin Meditation and Save Ritual buttons on pre-meditation page
- Add dynamic title to meditation guide container that reflects selected meditation type
- Add semi-transparent background with theme color and hover glow to play/pause button on meditation page
- Reduce height of time control and volume control input containers on meditation page
- Fix time control slider direction so dragging left decreases time and dragging right increases time

**User-visible outcome:** Users experience more appropriately sized buttons and controls, see a helpful dynamic guide title, and interact with a corrected time slider that responds intuitively to drag direction.
