# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refine meditation session controls and reorganize pre-meditation page layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Move meditation guide container to bottom of pre-meditation page
- Add hover glow effect to pause/play button using theme color
- Fix pause/play button to control both audio and timer simultaneously
- Add themed container with time scrubber and volume controls (with percentage display)
- Adjust timer text color for theme compatibility (white/light in dark theme, black/dark in light theme)

**User-visible outcome:** Users will have improved meditation session controls with a time scrubber for navigation, clearer volume indication, properly functioning pause/play that stops both audio and timer, and a reorganized pre-meditation page with the guide at the bottom.
