# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix meditation page slider behavior, restore back button, and match button dimensions in pre-meditation page.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix time control slider in meditation page to behave normally (dragging right increases time, dragging left decreases time)
- Restore back button in meditation page with same styling and position as in pre-meditation page
- Match 'Begin Meditation' button dimensions (height and width) to 'Save Ritual' button in pre-meditation page

**User-visible outcome:** Users can control the meditation timer slider with intuitive left/right dragging, navigate back from the meditation page using the restored back button, and see consistently sized action buttons in the pre-meditation page.
