# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Polish the pre-meditation and in-session meditation UI by improving layout and control usability while preserving existing behaviors.

**Planned changes:**
- On the pre-meditation setup view, reposition the “More Details” button to be horizontally centered at the bottom edge of the meditation guide container while keeping its current navigation behavior.
- On the in-session (active) view, increase the size/padding of the volume and time/seek slider containers to provide a larger visual and hit area, keeping both as standard slider inputs with the same behavior.
- On the in-session (active) view, restyle the play/pause button to better match the app theme and adjust its size/shape (not only colors) while keeping its toggle behavior and icons unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** In setup, “More Details” appears centered at the bottom of the guide container; in-session sliders are easier to interact with; and the play/pause control looks more cohesive with the app theme and has an improved touch-friendly shape/size.
