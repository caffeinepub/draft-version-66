  "summary": "Frontend changes in SavedRitualsCarousel implement an async confirm-delete flow that awaits onDelete and only closes/reset the dialog after success, keeping the dialog open on failure. The useQueries hook is described as normalizing the authenticated delete payload (including required ritual fields and bigint/Nat conversions) and invalidating the rituals query on success. Backend deleteRitual hardening/persistent ritualsStore update is not evidenced in the provided backend/main.mo diff excerpt.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Harden and correct the backend canister’s deleteRitual implementation to accept the frontend ritual payload, delete matching ritual(s) for the caller, and persistently write the updated rituals list back into ritualsStore so subsequent listCallerRituals reflects the deletion.",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff content shown is truncated and does not include any visible changes to deleteRitual or ritualsStore update logic; therefore implementation of the required persistent deletion behavior cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (truncated; no deleteRitual/ritualsStore update shown)"
