However, two additional files (project_state.json and frontend-file-summaries.txt) were modified even though the request constrained changes to only the ProgressBowl canvas element/behavior.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly constrained changes to the selected element (`frontend/src/components/ProgressBowl.tsx`) and its direct canvas-rendering behavior; updating project state metadata is unrelated to removing top empty space in the canvas.",
