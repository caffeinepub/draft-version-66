  "summary": "The diff updates `frontend/src/index.css` to define light (`:root`) and dark (`.dark`) theme tokens as space-separated OKLCH channels (Tailwind-compatible) and includes the requested custom tokens. However, the diff also introduces non-requested global styling changes (font import, multiple new animations/utilities) that go beyond “restoring/aliging global theme variables,” and the truncated diff does not provide evidence that the token values exactly match the user-provided palette.",

      "requirement": "Replace the app’s global theme CSS variables in `frontend/src/index.css` with the exact user-provided OKLCH values for all listed tokens (light `:root` and dark `.dark`).",
      "reason": "While the required tokens appear to be present, the BuildRequest requires the variables to \"exactly match the user-provided values.\" The diff summary does not include the user-provided reference values, and the file content is truncated, so exact matching cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",

    {
      "description": "Added multiple custom utility animations/effects (e.g., fade-in, breathe-gentle, glow-pulse, glow-pulse-strong, float, wave keyframes) and related styling beyond theme token restoration.",
      "reason": "These are additional global styles/visual behaviors not requested by REQ-1/REQ-2 and appear outside the scope of restoring global theme variables.",
