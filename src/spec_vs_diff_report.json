  "summary": "The diff appears to implement deep-linking from PreMeditationPage to KnowledgePage using a category search param, and updates KnowledgePage to initialize/select category from that param while preserving the existing scrollToContent behavior and clearing only that flag after scrolling.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "PreMeditationPage changes beyond the specified single “More details” button update (e.g., responsive slider width tweaks, light/dark background behavior changes, lotus intensity/variant changes, ritual instant-start via search params, additional cloud-sync error mapping).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly limits REQ-1 to only updating the selected “More details” button element’s navigation behavior; these additional behaviors are not requested and are outside the stated scope/non-goals.",
