  "summary": "The diff shows updates primarily captured in a modified documentation-like summary file and project state tracking, plus a truncated change to PreMeditationPage.tsx. The requirements appear to be addressed per the PreMeditationPage entry in frontend-file-summaries.txt, but the diff also includes (at least as-described) multiple unrelated UI/architecture changes outside the BuildRequest scope.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Multiple unrelated frontend changes outside the specified Pre-Meditation button label and active meditation controls (e.g., App router/toaster setup, Landing page redesign/redirect logic, canvas background variants/intensity controls, FeatureCard icon styling, global CSS token system updates, Tailwind config extensions, React Query ritual deletion payload normalization, Dashboard changes, carousel changes, floating nav changes).",
      "reason": "These changes are not requested and conflict with the non-goal of avoiding unrelated UI changes outside the specified button/controls. The only explicitly requested scope is the Pre-Meditation button label text and the active meditation controls UI; the diff summary describes many additional areas.",
