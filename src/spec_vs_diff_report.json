  "summary": "The diff clearly implements an always-column layout for the Journal filters container and adds a responsive Mood/Energy row that becomes two columns at >=540px. However, the diff is truncated before showing the Date From/To row and the Search/Clear overflow fixes, so those requirements cannot be confirmed. The diff also includes modifications to files outside the allowed scope (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json), which were not requested and violate the constraint to apply layout changes only to the selected element/container.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Date From and Date To inputs always share a single row with two columns regardless of screen width (including below 540px), without stacking vertically.",
      "reason": "The JournalFiltersDropdown.tsx diff is truncated before any Date From/Date To layout code appears, so there is no evidence the date inputs were placed in an always-two-column row across all breakpoints.",

      "reason": "The shown portion only covers the outer container and the Mood/Energy row. The diff is truncated before Search/Clear layout details, so overflow-prevention changes for those controls cannot be verified.",
