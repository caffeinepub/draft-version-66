  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be addressed on /pre-meditation via a new DurationRangeInput component and purported timer centering changes, but the diff also includes unrelated modifications (notably backend/main.mo and animation behavior changes) that go beyond the requested scope (REQ-3).",
