  "summary": "REQ-2 appears to be implemented (responsive min-height classes for the “Begin Meditation” button on small screens). REQ-1 is partially evidenced (the “More Details” button is described as moved to the bottom and still navigating to Knowledge), but the required `scrollToContent=true` search param is not explicitly evidenced in the provided diff summary. Additionally, the diff shows new/expanded in-page guide content being added, which is explicitly a non-goal and violates the constraint to apply changes only to the two selected elements.",
