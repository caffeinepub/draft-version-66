  "summary": "Diff updates PreMeditationPage, JournalPage, and ProgressPage to use StandardPageNav; PreMeditationPage also appears to remove the meditation type carousel, reintroduce the MeditationGuideStepper with a dismissible \"More details\" dialog, switch the active timer to MeditationTimerRing, and implement a sequential reflection step flow (mood → energy → note/favorite/save). No clear unrequested features are evidenced beyond these UX changes.",
