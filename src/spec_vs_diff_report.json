  "summary": "The diff appears to implement the requested UI changes on PreMeditationPage (moving “More Details”, enlarging slider areas, restyling play/pause) and adds new CSS utilities for sliders and the play/pause button, but it also includes additional global/theming and layout changes not explicitly requested. One REQ-7 acceptance criterion (“standard slider inputs”) cannot be confirmed and appears potentially violated due to use of the app’s Slider component.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "In the active phase, both volume and seek/time controls must remain standard slider inputs (no replacement with non-standard slider components), while increasing container size/padding.",
      "reason": "The diff shows PreMeditationPage using an imported Slider component (likely a custom/Radix slider) rather than a native/standard <input type=\"range\"> slider, so the 'standard slider inputs' criterion is not evidenced and may be unmet.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/PreMeditationPage.tsx (imports { Slider } from '@/components/ui/slider')",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions 'larger slider containers' but does not indicate native input sliders)"

      "description": "Global typography change to use the Google 'Playfair Display' font across the app.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked for UI polish within the pre-meditation setup/active views (button position, slider container sizing, play/pause styling). A global font import/family change is not requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (@import Playfair Display; body font-family set to 'Playfair Display')"

    {
      "description": "Broad global theme/token changes (restored/changed OKLCH color system variables and many custom tokens).",
      "reason": "Not requested; the requirements are limited to repositioning/restyling specific controls on PreMeditationPage.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (extensive :root and .dark OKLCH token definitions and custom color tokens)"
      ]

    {
      "description": "Addition of multiple new global animation utilities (fade-in, breathe, glow pulse, float, wave, etc.).",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-6/7/8; these are extra styling utilities beyond the specified UI polish items.",

    {
      "description": "Changes to pre-meditation page layout beyond the specified button/slider/play-pause adjustments (e.g., forced single-column setup layout; external labels above sliders).",
      "reason": "REQ-6/7/8 do not request broader layout restructuring or label repositioning—only the More Details button placement and control sizing/styling.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (PreMeditationPage: 'single-column layout forced at all widths for setup content', 'external labels positioned above larger slider containers')"
