  "summary": "REQ-2 and REQ-3 appear to be implemented in DashboardPage via opening QuizDialog for the 'quiz' carousel item and navigating to /pre-meditation with a validated `type` search param on quiz completion. REQ-1 is implemented structurally (switch to <img> icons), but the asset paths used include a leading `/` for all icons, which may not match the exact paths requested for mindfulness/ifs/metta.",
