  "summary": "All specified UI refinements appear to be implemented: dashboard background intensity is increased via PageBackgroundShell, pre-meditation setup content is reorganized into card containers with a \"More details\" button, the active play/pause button is circular, and the time scrubber behavior is described as corrected. Some additional ritual-related navigation behavior was added that was not requested.",

      "description": "Added/expanded ritual navigation to /pre-meditation including passing full ritual settings (duration, ambient sound, volume) and an autoStart flag, plus ritual deletion handling from the dashboard.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses only on background intensity, pre-meditation layout boxing, \"More details\" deep-linking, circular play/pause, and scrubber behavior—no changes were requested to ritual start/delete flows or adding auto-start behavior.",
